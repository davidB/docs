# Managing test plans

The unit for testing in Testground is a `test plan` also referred to as simply a `plan`. This document explains the layout of test plans directory in the Testground home directory, as well is tooling for managing local plans.

## Anatomy of a test plan

A test plan is a directory which contains the code to be executed during the test and a `toml`-formatted manifest file, which explains the plan to the Testground system.

Writing new test plans from scratch is covered elsewhere in this tutorial, for now, just know that a `test plan` is a directory with a test plan manifest and that each test plan may have one or more `test cases`.

Testground provides some basic functionality to assist importing and creating of test plans.

During execution, an archive of the plan is sent to the Testground daemon, where it is built and executed. Any code or files inside the plan's directory will be available when the plan is built. 

## Location of test plans

Test plans reside inside the Testground home directory in a subdirectory called `plans`.  The location of the Testground home is governed by an environment variable `$TESTGROUND_HOME` and has some sane defaults if this variable is unset.

By default, on unix-like operating systems, this directory is in the user's home directory. Don't worry about creating the Testground home directory in advance; it will be created for you when Testground runs.

```bash
$ tree $TESTGROUND_HOME

testground
├── data
│   ├── outputs
│   └── work
├── plans           # <-- This is where plans will go!
└── sdks
```

## Plan management tooling

Test plans can be managed using regular filesystem utilities. However, the Testground tool does have utilities for managing plans which can help to import and manage plans in a predictable way. For the following sections, I'll demonstrate a few management commands along with some standard utilities to explain what the command does.

### Creating new plans

```bash
# Create the plan
$ testground plan create -p myplan

# What happened?
$ tree $TESTGROUND_HOME

testground
├── data
│   ├── outputs
│   └── work
├── plans
│   └── myplan             # <-- the root of the plan you just created
│       ├── go.mod
│       ├── main.go        # <-- source code for your your new plan
│       └── manifest.toml  # <-- manifest for your new plan
└── sdks
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can modify the behaviour of `plan create`using command-line flags to change the module or add a git remote.
{% endhint %}

### Importing existing plans

Importing existing plans requires a `--from` flag. The source can be either from the local filesystem or downloaded from a git repository. When importing plans from a local filesystem, a symbolic link is created from the source to the plan directory. When `git` is used,  the plan is imported over any protocol supported by git.

#### ...from the local filesystem

```bash
# Import multiple plans from your local filesystem
# Changing the name to "myplans" (not required)

$ testground plan import --from /local/plans/dir/ --name myplans

created symlink $TESTGROUND_HOME/plans/myplans -> /local/plans/dir/
imported plans:
myplans/verify     uses-data-network
myplans/network    ping-pong
myplans/benchmarks all
myplans/benchmarks startup
myplans/benchmarks netinit
myplans/benchmarks netlinkshape
myplans/benchmarks barrier
myplans/benchmarks subtree
myplans/placebo    ok
myplans/placebo    abort
myplans/placebo    metrics
myplans/placebo    panic
myplans/placebo    stall
myplans/example    output
myplans/example    failure
myplans/example    panic
myplans/example    params
myplans/example    sync
myplans/example    metrics

# What happened?
# a symbolic link has been created to point to the source on my local filesystem

$ ls -l $TESTGROUND_HOME/plans

total 3
drwxr-xr-x 1 cory users  60 May  4 15:01 myplan
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cory users  56 May  4 15:36 myplans -> /local/plans/dir/
```

#### ...from a git repository

```bash
# Import multiple plans from the same git repo

$ testground plan import --git --from https://github.com/libp2p/test-plans

# What happened?
# The repository was cloned with the git remote set to the source.

$ cd $TESTGROUND_HOME/plans/test-plans

$ git remote -v

origin	git@github.com:libp2p/test-plans (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:libp2p/test-plans (push)
```

### Listing existing test plans

As you can see from the commands above, we have the ability to create new plans which we will write ourselves or import existing plans or collections of plans. Let's show them all with the `list` command:

```bash
# Generate a list of all test plans, along with all test cases in each plan.
# These are all the plans imported or created

$ testground plan list --testcases

myplan             quickstart
myplans/benchmarks all
myplans/benchmarks startup
myplans/benchmarks netinit
myplans/benchmarks netlinkshape
myplans/benchmarks barrier
myplans/benchmarks subtree
test-plans/dht     find-peers
test-plans/dht     find-providers
test-plans/dht     provide-stress
test-plans/dht     store-get-value
test-plans/dht     get-closest-peers
test-plans/dht     bootstrap-network
test-plans/dht     all
myplans/example    output
myplans/example    failure
myplans/example    panic
myplans/example    params
myplans/example    sync
myplans/example    metrics
myplans/network    ping-pong
myplans/placebo    ok
myplans/placebo    abort
myplans/placebo    metrics
myplans/placebo    panic
myplans/placebo    stall
myplans/verify     uses-data-network
```

### Removing test plans

Finally, let's end by removing a plan we are no longer interested in:

```bash
# Examples? Who needs em!

$ testground plan rm -p myplans/example

# Oops! This command is destructive, so it needs a confirmation.

$ testground plan rm -p myplans/example --yes
```
